# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** The bot must never lose funds beyond gas costs — the 4-layer safety system (off-chain estimate, eth_call simulation, on-chain ProfitValidator, MEV protection) ensures every transaction either profits or reverts.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Chain Research

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Move away from Ethereum mainnet (too saturated for small capital, gas too high)
- EVM-first chain selection (reuse existing Solidity contracts and ethers.js bot)
- Research + testnet only for v1 (validate before risking real funds)
- Monorepo architecture (single repo for all chain implementations)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
