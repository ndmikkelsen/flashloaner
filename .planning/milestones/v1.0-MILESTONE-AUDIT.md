# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Multi-Chain Expansion (Arbitrum)
**Audited:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** tech_debt
**Overall Score:** 19/19 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

All 19 v1 requirements are functionally satisfied. The bot has been validated on Arbitrum Sepolia (62m53s run, 3,769 opportunities, 0 errors) and subsequently iterated on Arbitrum mainnet with dry-runs. 772 tests pass (312 Solidity + 460 TypeScript). The sole issue is **missing GSD process artifacts** for Phase 4 — the work was done but SUMMARY.md and VERIFICATION.md files were never created because Phase 4 was executed via human action rather than GSD's automated plan execution.

No code-level blockers or broken flows exist.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 1: Chain Research (CHAIN-01, CHAIN-02, CHAIN-03)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Body | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| CHAIN-01 | SATISFIED | Validated in 01-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| CHAIN-02 | SATISFIED | Validated in 01-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| CHAIN-03 | SATISFIED | Validated in 01-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (DEPLOY-01..04, REPO-01..03)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Body | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| DEPLOY-01 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-04-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DEPLOY-02 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-04-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DEPLOY-03 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-04-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DEPLOY-04 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-04-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| REPO-01 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| REPO-02 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| REPO-03 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 02-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

### Phase 3: Bot Adaptation (BOT-01..05)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Body | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| BOT-01 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 03-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BOT-02 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 03-01-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BOT-03 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 03-04-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BOT-04 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 03-02/03-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BOT-05 | SATISFIED | Confirmed in 03-03-SUMMARY | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

### Phase 4: Testnet Validation (TEST-01..04)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Body | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| TEST-01 | MISSING | MISSING | `[x]` | **satisfied** (evidence: STATE.md — 62m53s, 0 errors) |
| TEST-02 | MISSING | MISSING | `[x]` | **satisfied** (evidence: STATE.md — 3,769 opportunities) |
| TEST-03 | MISSING | MISSING | `[x]` | **satisfied** (evidence: STATE.md — eth_call simulation worked) |
| TEST-04 | MISSING | MISSING | `[x]` | **satisfied** (evidence: 772 tests pass, `pnpm test` + `forge test`) |

**Note on Phase 4:** Strict 3-source cross-reference yields `partial` (verification gap) for TEST-01 through TEST-04. However, the requirements ARE functionally met — STATE.md documents the successful 62m53s bot run with 3,769 opportunities and 0 errors. The 772 passing tests confirm TEST-04. The gap is in GSD process documentation, not in actual deliverables. Status elevated to `satisfied` based on STATE.md + test suite evidence.

### Orphaned Requirements

None. All 19 requirements in the traceability table are covered by at least one phase VERIFICATION.md or STATE.md evidence.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Score |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Chain Research | 01-01-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 4/4 truths |
| Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup | 02-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 12/12 truths |
| Phase 3: Bot Adaptation | 03-VERIFICATION.md | human_needed | 5/5 truths |
| Phase 4: Testnet Validation | **MISSING** | unverified (artifacts) | N/A |

**Phase 4 Note:** Phase 4 was executed as human-action plans (live bot run + manual verification). The plans exist (04-01-PLAN.md, 04-02-PLAN.md) and the work was completed, but SUMMARY.md and VERIFICATION.md artifacts were never generated. This is expected for human-action plans that don't go through GSD's automated execution pipeline.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker score: 14/14 connections wired, 0 broken**

### Verified Connections

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Phase 1 ARBITRUM.md | Phase 2 chain configs | Aave V3 Pool address `0x794a61...` | WIRED |
| Phase 1 ARBITRUM.md | Phase 2 chain configs | Balancer Vault `0xBA12...` | WIRED (resolved from TBD) |
| Phase 2 loadChainConfig | Phase 3 run-arb-sepolia.ts | `loadChainConfig(421614)` | WIRED |
| Phase 2 deployment artifact | Phase 4 pre-flight checks | `deployments/421614.json` | WIRED (reference) |
| Phase 3 pool config | PriceMonitor | `ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_POOLS` → `pools:` | WIRED |
| Phase 3 gas estimator | OpportunityDetector | `setGasEstimator()` injection | WIRED |
| Phase 3 reporting | Phase 4 validation | L1 data fee in `formatOpportunityReport` | WIRED |

### E2E Flow: `pnpm bot:arb-sepolia`

```
package.json → run-arb-sepolia.ts → loadChainConfig(421614) → FlashloanBot()
→ PriceMonitor.start() → pollMulticall() → slot0() on V3 pools
→ detectOpportunities() → analyzeDeltaAsync() → ArbitrumGasEstimator
→ emit "opportunityFound" → formatOpportunityReport() → console.log
→ SIGINT → shutdown() → logStats()
```

**Status: COMPLETE** — all 12 steps verified end-to-end.

### Notable Finding

`run-arb-sepolia.ts` line 107 assigns `chain.protocols.aaveV3Pool` to a variable named `flashloanExecutor`. The gas estimate targets the Aave pool address, not the deployed FlashloanExecutor. For L1 data fee estimation, the `to` address has minimal impact (L1 fee is driven by calldata size, not destination). Functionally adequate but naming is misleading.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 4: Missing GSD Artifacts

| Item | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| No 04-01-SUMMARY.md | Process gap only; work is done | Accept — STATE.md provides evidence |
| No 04-02-SUMMARY.md | Process gap only; work is done | Accept — 772 tests confirm TEST-04 |
| No 04-VERIFICATION.md | Phase 4 unverified in GSD | Accept — human-action plans by design |
| NodeInterface gas target naming | Misleading variable name | Low priority — fix if touching the file |

### Accumulated from Earlier Phases

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Phase 2 | Zero-address token placeholders in arbitrum-sepolia.ts lines 43-45 | Info (testnet only) |
| Phase 3 | 3 human verification items requiring live RPC | Info (validated by Phase 4 run) |

## Conclusion

**v1.0 milestone is ready for completion.** All 19 requirements are satisfied with functional evidence. The tech debt is exclusively process-level (missing GSD artifacts for Phase 4) and does not affect code quality, test coverage, or delivered functionality. The bot has been validated on both Arbitrum Sepolia (testnet) and Arbitrum mainnet (dry-run mode) with 772 passing tests.
